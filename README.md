The details for the project are as below: 

### Hypothesis 1 :
If the salary of the employee is less than expected, it leads to attrition

We have two datasets where in we would merge them based on the age and the education level. One of the datasets has the actual income and the other has a generic expected income.

#### Analysis Results:
##### Entire data with attrition 'Yes' and 'No'

### Hypothesis 2 : 
Relationship between income and age is stronger than that between income and education.

### Hypothesis 3 : 
Do factors such as business travel, age and distance from home have any effect on the decision of an employee leaving the organization.
